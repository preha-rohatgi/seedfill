# seedfill
In this method, a point or seed which is inside region is selected. This point is called a seed point. Then four connected approaches or eight connected approaches is used to fill with specified color.In fill algorithm, we start from a specified interior point (x, y) and reassign all pixel values are currently set to a given interior color with the desired color. Using either a 4-connected or 8-connected approaches, we then step through pixel positions until all interior points have been repainted.
